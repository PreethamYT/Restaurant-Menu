# Divine Kitchen - Restaurant Menu

A simple restaurant menu website I built while learning HTML through Codédex.

## What it is

This is a menu website for a fictional Indian vegetarian restaurant called Divine Kitchen. It has a navbar, menu items with pictures and prices, and an order form at the bottom.

## Menu Items

- Paneer Makhani - $3
- Gulab Jamun - $1.43  
- Veg Grilled Sandwich - $4

## What I learned

- How to structure HTML pages properly
- Using forms and input fields
- Making things align with flexbox (that was tricky!)
- Adding navigation links that jump to different sections
- Embedding images

## How to run

Just download the `restaurent_menu.html` file and open it in any browser.
